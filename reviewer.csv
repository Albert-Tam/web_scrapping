I've been using the basic account but wanted to upgrade to the pro account for improved functionality, however I can now only have a five person account as a minimum with a ridiculous price tag of £69 a month! HUGELY disappointed that Monday.com has decided to effectively close off its software to users like me (I appealed to customer service to upgrade to pro on my current two person account but no positive help). Its hugely short sighted of Monday.com - as many small businesses grow into larger ones who would roll out the system as new people joined. By increasing the bill so much for startups like mine they are effectively forcing me to find a new system, and having to move for such negative reasons means I will not come back to them in the future, which is surely missing a huge organic marketing opportunity. Very short sighted and unsupportive of small businesses and sole traders when the difficulties of the pandemic really call for the absolute opposite approach.

,allison cornelius,1 star: Bad,VERY POOR SUPPORT DURING SALE AND CONFLICTING QUOTES,"We are a large nonprofit organization and started reviewing collaboration and project flow software about a month ago. We had narrowed it down to Wrike and Monday.com. Overall our leadership team preferred Monday.com due to the simplicity of the design, the price, the library of ready-to-use templates, and what looks to be an easy and intuitive user experience. However, the contrast between how these two companies have handled us as a potential customer has been remarkable and that’s what worries me.In my experience if a company cannot support the selling process, when you are trying to give them your money, then it probably won’t be much better after the sale.Monday.com gave us a trial period which they extended during the vetting process. They invited us to participate in a very, very large group demo which was not conducive to Q&A. We took several online tutorials and were sold on how easy Monday.com would be to learn, the design and feel, and their large library of ready-to-go templates. But we couldn’t figure out how we would structure our departments within the software and I could not see how the Senior Leadership Team would be able to get a quality 45,000 foot view of the organization’s work. It looked to me like we could end up with basically what equates to tons of task lists on steroids.Every time we submitted a question to Monday.com, we were doing it by email and communicating to someone different. That made choosing the right plan a bit difficult. Nevertheless, we decided to purchase Monday.com PRO LEVEL, and we asked for the NGO quote for the Pro Level.After several days of not getting a reply, we requested again. We then received a call from a 3rd party sales rep. When we attempted to call her back, there was no way to leave a voice mail. When we finally reached her, she told us she didn't know a lot about the details of the software (huh?) but that it sounded like we might actually need the higher Enterprise level. We looked at the features of Enterprise and realized Pro would not work for our needs. We then submitted another request for the NGO quote for Enterprise. We got that quote in writing a day later. When we attempted to follow the directions sent with the quote to purchase the product, the system required us to submit yet another contact form - which we did.We then received an email with a totally different price than the one sent the day before (about $8K-$10K higher!). We asked why we had been given two different quotes. Now during all this time, we are corresponding or speaking to Elisa, Erick, Helen, Lauren, Fanny, Tammy, and Noreply – the Customer Service Team. And that's while I am just trying to buy the product?Monday has a beautiful product that we liked better, but if they cannot answer simple questions accurately (like how much is it? and what do we need?) during the sales phase, I fear their support post sale will not be much different. It has been incredibly inefficient.In contrast, Wrike assigned one salesperson who did a live demo with our leadership team. She answered tons of questions and mined for more. Wrike also gave us a trial period and extended it. We vetted Wrike thoroughly and while we preferred some of its features, we worried it was far too expensive and too complex for our needs. It looked like a steep learning curve for our team. Wrike does not have lots of templates and we would have to make our own – we worried it would take too long to get it up and running.But during the sales process the Wrike rep has answered every question thoroughly and within a couple of hours, sometimes minutes. She has called us every day wanting to discuss their product's features and benefits against Monday.com's.My dad always told me when purchasing IT to never confuse sell with install. In this instance Monday.com does not even seem to be able to sell.Back to the drawing board.",1 review,True,<reviewer.Reviewer object at 0x7f1569703f10>

But:No way to make a rule about only one time tracking at the time. If you want to change task midt work, you will need to stop tracking on your current task and then start tracking on the next task.Should you track two task at the same time. There is no where to get an overview of your currenct time tracking sessions. So hope you do not have to many workspaces.When you find your session and want to change it to the currect time, will you an everyone else need to reload there browser to get the update in there statics page.Do not use Monday if time tracking is important for you. Either look for something else, or find a system that you can embed into Monday.com instead.I would love to see an overview of all my tasks in deadline order. I can't. I can see an overview of all my tasks for max 1 year ahead. But not for more then 10 workspaces at the time. I could search for my name in the search menu. But there is no way to order sorte the tasks.For small companyes this would not be a problem. But if you need to make pipeline for the next 2 years with over 1000 tasks. Well you are not going to have a good time with Monday.Support is fast at replying. 1-2 hours. I guess they have follow the sun support.But i fine my self asking for at feature or asking about a bug, and then getting told a solution, that do not fit the feature or fixing the bug.I have to ask them to stop talking about other features, before they inform me that the software can not fulfil my request.I also get a new support person every answer. Not a big deal, but I do get ask what my request is more the one time in the threat. Seems like there support is to busy to read the old messages in the support ticket.Monday have some good features. But all of them feel 80% done. They want to seem to be this 100% dynamic todo management software. But only 100% dynamic in 40% of the features. The rest is limited or do not work.If Monday had used maybe 50% of there youtube ad budget on testing and polish of there software, then maybe it would have been something i could requirement. Right now, is Asana + Everhour a better solution. Only part Asana is missing that Monday have is a workload tool and a proper timeline/milestone tool.",1 review,True,<reviewer.Reviewer object at 0x7f1569692150>

Their solution was to offer me a 10% discount on a yearly plan.Did you catch that? Their solution to overcharging me was to ask me to spend $1,100 to be locked in to a year of service instead of $120/mo when we haven't even had enough time with the service to know if it works well for our use case.Super tone-deaf.From a software usage perspective, so far it's just OK. It's a bit buggy and slow and they have a lot of nagging alerts prompting you to do walkthroughs which are annoying. Also, even though we've already paid for a level of service, there's a permanent ""Upgrade"" button in the UI that doesn't go away, prompting you to get a higher tier of service.

I've been using the basic account but wanted to upgrade to the pro account for improved functionality, however I can now only have a five person account as a minimum with a ridiculous price tag of £69 a month! HUGELY disappointed that Monday.com has decided to effectively close off its software to users like me (I appealed to customer service to upgrade to pro on my current two person account but no positive help). Its hugely short sighted of Monday.com - as many small businesses grow into larger ones who would roll out the system as new people joined. By increasing the bill so much for startups like mine they are effectively forcing me to find a new system, and having to move for such negative reasons means I will not come back to them in the future, which is surely missing a huge organic marketing opportunity. Very short sighted and unsupportive of small businesses and sole traders when the difficulties of the pandemic really call for the absolute opposite approach.

,allison cornelius,1 star: Bad,VERY POOR SUPPORT DURING SALE AND CONFLICTING QUOTES,"We are a large nonprofit organization and started reviewing collaboration and project flow software about a month ago. We had narrowed it down to Wrike and Monday.com. Overall our leadership team preferred Monday.com due to the simplicity of the design, the price, the library of ready-to-use templates, and what looks to be an easy and intuitive user experience. However, the contrast between how these two companies have handled us as a potential customer has been remarkable and that’s what worries me.In my experience if a company cannot support the selling process, when you are trying to give them your money, then it probably won’t be much better after the sale.Monday.com gave us a trial period which they extended during the vetting process. They invited us to participate in a very, very large group demo which was not conducive to Q&A. We took several online tutorials and were sold on how easy Monday.com would be to learn, the design and feel, and their large library of ready-to-go templates. But we couldn’t figure out how we would structure our departments within the software and I could not see how the Senior Leadership Team would be able to get a quality 45,000 foot view of the organization’s work. It looked to me like we could end up with basically what equates to tons of task lists on steroids.Every time we submitted a question to Monday.com, we were doing it by email and communicating to someone different. That made choosing the right plan a bit difficult. Nevertheless, we decided to purchase Monday.com PRO LEVEL, and we asked for the NGO quote for the Pro Level.After several days of not getting a reply, we requested again. We then received a call from a 3rd party sales rep. When we attempted to call her back, there was no way to leave a voice mail. When we finally reached her, she told us she didn't know a lot about the details of the software (huh?) but that it sounded like we might actually need the higher Enterprise level. We looked at the features of Enterprise and realized Pro would not work for our needs. We then submitted another request for the NGO quote for Enterprise. We got that quote in writing a day later. When we attempted to follow the directions sent with the quote to purchase the product, the system required us to submit yet another contact form - which we did.We then received an email with a totally different price than the one sent the day before (about $8K-$10K higher!). We asked why we had been given two different quotes. Now during all this time, we are corresponding or speaking to Elisa, Erick, Helen, Lauren, Fanny, Tammy, and Noreply – the Customer Service Team. And that's while I am just trying to buy the product?Monday has a beautiful product that we liked better, but if they cannot answer simple questions accurately (like how much is it? and what do we need?) during the sales phase, I fear their support post sale will not be much different. It has been incredibly inefficient.In contrast, Wrike assigned one salesperson who did a live demo with our leadership team. She answered tons of questions and mined for more. Wrike also gave us a trial period and extended it. We vetted Wrike thoroughly and while we preferred some of its features, we worried it was far too expensive and too complex for our needs. It looked like a steep learning curve for our team. Wrike does not have lots of templates and we would have to make our own – we worried it would take too long to get it up and running.But during the sales process the Wrike rep has answered every question thoroughly and within a couple of hours, sometimes minutes. She has called us every day wanting to discuss their product's features and benefits against Monday.com's.My dad always told me when purchasing IT to never confuse sell with install. In this instance Monday.com does not even seem to be able to sell.Back to the drawing board.",1 review,True,<reviewer.Reviewer object at 0x7f01dbbce150>

If you want to change task midt work, you will need to stop tracking on your current task and then start tracking on the next task.Should you track two task at the same time. There is no where to get an overview of your currenct time tracking sessions. So hope you do not have to many workspaces.When you find your session and want to change it to the currect time, will you an everyone else need to reload there browser to get the update in there statics page.Do not use Monday if time tracking is important for you. Either look for something else, or find a system that you can embed into Monday.com instead.I would love to see an overview of all my tasks in deadline order. I can't. I can see an overview of all my tasks for max 1 year ahead. But not for more then 10 workspaces at the time. I could search for my name in the search menu. But there is no way to order sorte the tasks.For small companyes this would not be a problem. But if you need to make pipeline for the next 2 years with over 1000 tasks. Well you are not going to have a good time with Monday.Support is fast at replying. 1-2 hours. I guess they have follow the sun support.But i fine my self asking for at feature or asking about a bug, and then getting told a solution, that do not fit the feature or fixing the bug.I have to ask them to stop talking about other features, before they inform me that the software can not fulfil my request.I also get a new support person every answer. Not a big deal, but I do get ask what my request is more the one time in the threat. Seems like there support is to busy to read the old messages in the support ticket.Monday have some good features. But all of them feel 80% done. They want to seem to be this 100% dynamic todo management software. But only 100% dynamic in 40% of the features. The rest is limited or do not work.If Monday had used maybe 50% of there youtube ad budget on testing and polish of there software, then maybe it would have been something i could requirement. Right now, is Asana + Everhour a better solution. Only part Asana is missing that Monday have is a workload tool and a proper timeline/milestone tool.",1 review,True,<reviewer.Reviewer object at 0x7f01dbc47e10>

I was told log into my account and select 10 Users Pro Monthly and I would be charged the difference monthly. I wasn't. I was charged for the full 10 users monthly and my 5 Users Pro Yearly has apparently gone to waste.When I wanted to go back down to 5 users which I have already paid for I switched to 5 Pro Users on 04/21/2020. I was charged $77.94 USD. Not sure why if I had already paid for it.It renewed 05/21/2020 for 77.94 USD again. I asked support why I was being billed when I had already paid for the 5 Users Pro Yearly. They told me to go into the billing and switch from Monthly to Yearly.I was charged another $689.77..? They need to fix their billing. I have requested a refund and will be moving to another platform.,1 review,True,<reviewer.Reviewer object at 0x7f01dbbe1bd0>

,Mark Q,1 star: Bad,Beware: their user-hostile pricing is designed to overcharge you!,"They force you to purchase plans in increments of 5 teammates. That means if I have 6 people on my team I'm forced to buy a plan for 10 teammates which is literally double the cost for 1 more person.This is a user-hostile pricing structure that is purposefully designed to overcharge businesses.I wrote in to their customer service and complained. Their solution was to offer me a 10% discount on a yearly plan.Did you catch that? Their solution to overcharging me was to ask me to spend $1,100 to be locked in to a year of service instead of $120/mo when we haven't even had enough time with the service to know if it works well for our use case.Super tone-deaf.From a software usage perspective, so far it's just OK. It's a bit buggy and slow and they have a lot of nagging alerts prompting you to do walkthroughs which are annoying. Also, even though we've already paid for a level of service, there's a permanent ""Upgrade"" button in the UI that doesn't go away, prompting you to get a higher tier of service. Overall not a great experience and makes me feel gross about using it. We're looking at alternatives now.",1 review,True,<reviewer.Reviewer object at 0x7f01dbbe1b90>

Seeing how powerful this program we pitched it to our Data internship team for Assuaged, Inc. They spent about a week trying to figure out the type of software we needed to productively build database systems and everyone concluded to Monday for a variety of reasons. Some of the features they have do not exist on other platforms.We are finally able to organize all the tasks in one area. The colors help maintain fluidity and balance and the software itself allows us to maintain organization during times of having to handle multiple projects and tasks without losing where we last left off.We have imported several Excel spreadsheets successfully and now we can move items from ideation stages, to creation stages, to completion/published stages. Monday is systematically operational and effective across all levels!Also, the support is out of this world, this company truly cares about the user and user experience, they prioritize your satisfaction.Monday's services are unparallel to any other project management tools by far in terms of time, deliverability and especially by offering the whole package at a much cheaper cost.NOW our team can interact effectively and we can better coordinate without the use of google spreadsheets which can often take longer getting things done opposed to using Monday conveniently from your desktop.Many quotes say Mondays are Mondays but with Monday we now love Mondays!

You can basically make Monday do anything that other packages can do, and more, by customising it to your needs. Forms and timelines are a very nice addition, so now we run the roadmap on it, internal feedback and support system, almost everything.It's not perfect yet but I'm sure they are working on it and the limitations are insignificant.

It is very easy to build custom boards and to communicate via software instead of impromptu hallway meetings.The downsides are that it is expensive.

I've been using the basic account but wanted to upgrade to the pro account for improved functionality, however I can now only have a five person account as a minimum with a ridiculous price tag of £69 a month! HUGELY disappointed that Monday.com has decided to effectively close off its software to users like me (I appealed to customer service to upgrade to pro on my current two person account but no positive help). Its hugely short sighted of Monday.com - as many small businesses grow into larger ones who would roll out the system as new people joined. By increasing the bill so much for startups like mine they are effectively forcing me to find a new system, and having to move for such negative reasons means I will not come back to them in the future, which is surely missing a huge organic marketing opportunity. Very short sighted and unsupportive of small businesses and sole traders when the difficulties of the pandemic really call for the absolute opposite approach.

,allison cornelius,1 star: Bad,VERY POOR SUPPORT DURING SALE AND CONFLICTING QUOTES,"We are a large nonprofit organization and started reviewing collaboration and project flow software about a month ago. We had narrowed it down to Wrike and Monday.com. Overall our leadership team preferred Monday.com due to the simplicity of the design, the price, the library of ready-to-use templates, and what looks to be an easy and intuitive user experience. However, the contrast between how these two companies have handled us as a potential customer has been remarkable and that’s what worries me.In my experience if a company cannot support the selling process, when you are trying to give them your money, then it probably won’t be much better after the sale.Monday.com gave us a trial period which they extended during the vetting process. They invited us to participate in a very, very large group demo which was not conducive to Q&A. We took several online tutorials and were sold on how easy Monday.com would be to learn, the design and feel, and their large library of ready-to-go templates. But we couldn’t figure out how we would structure our departments within the software and I could not see how the Senior Leadership Team would be able to get a quality 45,000 foot view of the organization’s work. It looked to me like we could end up with basically what equates to tons of task lists on steroids.Every time we submitted a question to Monday.com, we were doing it by email and communicating to someone different. That made choosing the right plan a bit difficult. Nevertheless, we decided to purchase Monday.com PRO LEVEL, and we asked for the NGO quote for the Pro Level.After several days of not getting a reply, we requested again. We then received a call from a 3rd party sales rep. When we attempted to call her back, there was no way to leave a voice mail. When we finally reached her, she told us she didn't know a lot about the details of the software (huh?) but that it sounded like we might actually need the higher Enterprise level. We looked at the features of Enterprise and realized Pro would not work for our needs. We then submitted another request for the NGO quote for Enterprise. We got that quote in writing a day later. When we attempted to follow the directions sent with the quote to purchase the product, the system required us to submit yet another contact form - which we did.We then received an email with a totally different price than the one sent the day before (about $8K-$10K higher!). We asked why we had been given two different quotes. Now during all this time, we are corresponding or speaking to Elisa, Erick, Helen, Lauren, Fanny, Tammy, and Noreply – the Customer Service Team. And that's while I am just trying to buy the product?Monday has a beautiful product that we liked better, but if they cannot answer simple questions accurately (like how much is it? and what do we need?) during the sales phase, I fear their support post sale will not be much different. It has been incredibly inefficient.In contrast, Wrike assigned one salesperson who did a live demo with our leadership team. She answered tons of questions and mined for more. Wrike also gave us a trial period and extended it. We vetted Wrike thoroughly and while we preferred some of its features, we worried it was far too expensive and too complex for our needs. It looked like a steep learning curve for our team. Wrike does not have lots of templates and we would have to make our own – we worried it would take too long to get it up and running.But during the sales process the Wrike rep has answered every question thoroughly and within a couple of hours, sometimes minutes. She has called us every day wanting to discuss their product's features and benefits against Monday.com's.My dad always told me when purchasing IT to never confuse sell with install. In this instance Monday.com does not even seem to be able to sell.Back to the drawing board.",1 review,True,<reviewer.Reviewer object at 0x7f5d1786ab90>

But:No way to make a rule about only one time tracking at the time. If you want to change task midt work, you will need to stop tracking on your current task and then start tracking on the next task.Should you track two task at the same time. There is no where to get an overview of your currenct time tracking sessions. So hope you do not have to many workspaces.When you find your session and want to change it to the currect time, will you an everyone else need to reload there browser to get the update in there statics page.Do not use Monday if time tracking is important for you. Either look for something else, or find a system that you can embed into Monday.com instead.I would love to see an overview of all my tasks in deadline order. I can't. I can see an overview of all my tasks for max 1 year ahead. But not for more then 10 workspaces at the time. I could search for my name in the search menu. But there is no way to order sorte the tasks.For small companyes this would not be a problem. But if you need to make pipeline for the next 2 years with over 1000 tasks. Well you are not going to have a good time with Monday.Support is fast at replying. 1-2 hours. I guess they have follow the sun support.But i fine my self asking for at feature or asking about a bug, and then getting told a solution, that do not fit the feature or fixing the bug.I have to ask them to stop talking about other features, before they inform me that the software can not fulfil my request.I also get a new support person every answer. Not a big deal, but I do get ask what my request is more the one time in the threat. Seems like there support is to busy to read the old messages in the support ticket.Monday have some good features. But all of them feel 80% done. They want to seem to be this 100% dynamic todo management software. But only 100% dynamic in 40% of the features. The rest is limited or do not work.If Monday had used maybe 50% of there youtube ad budget on testing and polish of there software, then maybe it would have been something i could requirement. Right now, is Asana + Everhour a better solution. Only part Asana is missing that Monday have is a workload tool and a proper timeline/milestone tool.",1 review,True,<reviewer.Reviewer object at 0x7f5d16fc9d50>

Their solution was to offer me a 10% discount on a yearly plan.Did you catch that? Their solution to overcharging me was to ask me to spend $1,100 to be locked in to a year of service instead of $120/mo when we haven't even had enough time with the service to know if it works well for our use case.Super tone-deaf.From a software usage perspective, so far it's just OK. It's a bit buggy and slow and they have a lot of nagging alerts prompting you to do walkthroughs which are annoying. Also, even though we've already paid for a level of service, there's a permanent ""Upgrade"" button in the UI that doesn't go away, prompting you to get a higher tier of service.

Forms and timelines are a very nice addition, so now we run the roadmap on it, internal feedback and support system, almost everything.It's not perfect yet but I'm sure they are working on it and the limitations are insignificant. I wish for more colour options and column types, and text description for the task groups and it's super annoying when cursor jumps to the end of the line while typing the task name, but these are very minor matters.",2 reviews,False,<reviewer.Reviewer object at 0x7f5d16eca390>

We have more visibility across the company and a more organised and happy team. All thanks to Monday.com.The integrations with some of our existing systems have reduced the amount of manual admin, and there has been a clear improvement in workflows.

I've been using the basic account but wanted to upgrade to the pro account for improved functionality, however I can now only have a five person account as a minimum with a ridiculous price tag of £69 a month! HUGELY disappointed that Monday.com has decided to effectively close off its software to users like me (I appealed to customer service to upgrade to pro on my current two person account but no positive help). Its hugely short sighted of Monday.com - as many small businesses grow into larger ones who would roll out the system as new people joined. By increasing the bill so much for startups like mine they are effectively forcing me to find a new system, and having to move for such negative reasons means I will not come back to them in the future, which is surely missing a huge organic marketing opportunity. Very short sighted and unsupportive of small businesses and sole traders when the difficulties of the pandemic really call for the absolute opposite approach.

,allison cornelius,1 star: Bad,VERY POOR SUPPORT DURING SALE AND CONFLICTING QUOTES,"We are a large nonprofit organization and started reviewing collaboration and project flow software about a month ago. We had narrowed it down to Wrike and Monday.com. Overall our leadership team preferred Monday.com due to the simplicity of the design, the price, the library of ready-to-use templates, and what looks to be an easy and intuitive user experience. However, the contrast between how these two companies have handled us as a potential customer has been remarkable and that’s what worries me.In my experience if a company cannot support the selling process, when you are trying to give them your money, then it probably won’t be much better after the sale.Monday.com gave us a trial period which they extended during the vetting process. They invited us to participate in a very, very large group demo which was not conducive to Q&A. We took several online tutorials and were sold on how easy Monday.com would be to learn, the design and feel, and their large library of ready-to-go templates. But we couldn’t figure out how we would structure our departments within the software and I could not see how the Senior Leadership Team would be able to get a quality 45,000 foot view of the organization’s work. It looked to me like we could end up with basically what equates to tons of task lists on steroids.Every time we submitted a question to Monday.com, we were doing it by email and communicating to someone different. That made choosing the right plan a bit difficult. Nevertheless, we decided to purchase Monday.com PRO LEVEL, and we asked for the NGO quote for the Pro Level.After several days of not getting a reply, we requested again. We then received a call from a 3rd party sales rep. When we attempted to call her back, there was no way to leave a voice mail. When we finally reached her, she told us she didn't know a lot about the details of the software (huh?) but that it sounded like we might actually need the higher Enterprise level. We looked at the features of Enterprise and realized Pro would not work for our needs. We then submitted another request for the NGO quote for Enterprise. We got that quote in writing a day later. When we attempted to follow the directions sent with the quote to purchase the product, the system required us to submit yet another contact form - which we did.We then received an email with a totally different price than the one sent the day before (about $8K-$10K higher!). We asked why we had been given two different quotes. Now during all this time, we are corresponding or speaking to Elisa, Erick, Helen, Lauren, Fanny, Tammy, and Noreply – the Customer Service Team. And that's while I am just trying to buy the product?Monday has a beautiful product that we liked better, but if they cannot answer simple questions accurately (like how much is it? and what do we need?) during the sales phase, I fear their support post sale will not be much different. It has been incredibly inefficient.In contrast, Wrike assigned one salesperson who did a live demo with our leadership team. She answered tons of questions and mined for more. Wrike also gave us a trial period and extended it. We vetted Wrike thoroughly and while we preferred some of its features, we worried it was far too expensive and too complex for our needs. It looked like a steep learning curve for our team. Wrike does not have lots of templates and we would have to make our own – we worried it would take too long to get it up and running.But during the sales process the Wrike rep has answered every question thoroughly and within a couple of hours, sometimes minutes. She has called us every day wanting to discuss their product's features and benefits against Monday.com's.My dad always told me when purchasing IT to never confuse sell with install. In this instance Monday.com does not even seem to be able to sell.Back to the drawing board.",1 review,True,<reviewer.Reviewer object at 0x7fc79f6d1310>
,Jason Reynolds,2 stars: Poor,Terrible user interface,"I've started using Monday recently as a client was already using it for design and development sprints.

,Peter Riisgaard Andresen,2 stars: Poor,Monday use a lot of time on YT ads.,"Monday do know how to youtube ads that shows what they can, but make it seems like i can much more.It have time tracking. But:No way to make a rule about only one time tracking at the time. If you want to change task midt work, you will need to stop tracking on your current task and then start tracking on the next task.Should you track two task at the same time. There is no where to get an overview of your currenct time tracking sessions. So hope you do not have to many workspaces.When you find your session and want to change it to the currect time, will you an everyone else need to reload there browser to get the update in there statics page.Do not use Monday if time tracking is important for you. Either look for something else, or find a system that you can embed into Monday.com instead.I would love to see an overview of all my tasks in deadline order. I can't. I can see an overview of all my tasks for max 1 year ahead. But not for more then 10 workspaces at the time. I could search for my name in the search menu. But there is no way to order sorte the tasks.For small companyes this would not be a problem. But if you need to make pipeline for the next 2 years with over 1000 tasks. Well you are not going to have a good time with Monday.Support is fast at replying. 1-2 hours. I guess they have follow the sun support.But i fine my self asking for at feature or asking about a bug, and then getting told a solution, that do not fit the feature or fixing the bug.I have to ask them to stop talking about other features, before they inform me that the software can not fulfil my request.I also get a new support person every answer. Not a big deal, but I do get ask what my request is more the one time in the threat. Seems like there support is to busy to read the old messages in the support ticket.Monday have some good features. But all of them feel 80% done. They want to seem to be this 100% dynamic todo management software. But only 100% dynamic in 40% of the features. The rest is limited or do not work.If Monday had used maybe 50% of there youtube ad budget on testing and polish of there software, then maybe it would have been something i could requirement. Right now, is Asana + Everhour a better solution. Only part Asana is missing that Monday have is a workload tool and a proper timeline/milestone tool.",1 review,True,<reviewer.Reviewer object at 0x7fc79f742e10>

I was told log into my account and select 10 Users Pro Monthly and I would be charged the difference monthly. I wasn't. I was charged for the full 10 users monthly and my 5 Users Pro Yearly has apparently gone to waste.When I wanted to go back down to 5 users which I have already paid for I switched to 5 Pro Users on 04/21/2020. I was charged $77.94 USD. Not sure why if I had already paid for it.It renewed 05/21/2020 for 77.94 USD again. I asked support why I was being billed when I had already paid for the 5 Users Pro Yearly. They told me to go into the billing and switch from Monthly to Yearly.I was charged another $689.77..? They need to fix their billing. I have requested a refund and will be moving to another platform.,1 review,True,<reviewer.Reviewer object at 0x7fc79f716a90>

That means if I have 6 people on my team I'm forced to buy a plan for 10 teammates which is literally double the cost for 1 more person.This is a user-hostile pricing structure that is purposefully designed to overcharge businesses.I wrote in to their customer service and complained. Their solution was to offer me a 10% discount on a yearly plan.Did you catch that? Their solution to overcharging me was to ask me to spend $1,100 to be locked in to a year of service instead of $120/mo when we haven't even had enough time with the service to know if it works well for our use case.Super tone-deaf.From a software usage perspective, so far it's just OK. It's a bit buggy and slow and they have a lot of nagging alerts prompting you to do walkthroughs which are annoying. Also, even though we've already paid for a level of service, there's a permanent ""Upgrade"" button in the UI that doesn't go away, prompting you to get a higher tier of service. Overall not a great experience and makes me feel gross about using it. We're looking at alternatives now.",1 review,True,<reviewer.Reviewer object at 0x7fc79f71db10>

Seeing how powerful this program we pitched it to our Data internship team for Assuaged, Inc. They spent about a week trying to figure out the type of software we needed to productively build database systems and everyone concluded to Monday for a variety of reasons. Some of the features they have do not exist on other platforms.We are finally able to organize all the tasks in one area. The colors help maintain fluidity and balance and the software itself allows us to maintain organization during times of having to handle multiple projects and tasks without losing where we last left off.We have imported several Excel spreadsheets successfully and now we can move items from ideation stages, to creation stages, to completion/published stages. Monday is systematically operational and effective across all levels!Also, the support is out of this world, this company truly cares about the user and user experience, they prioritize your satisfaction.Monday's services are unparallel to any other project management tools by far in terms of time, deliverability and especially by offering the whole package at a much cheaper cost.NOW our team can interact effectively and we can better coordinate without the use of google spreadsheets which can often take longer getting things done opposed to using Monday conveniently from your desktop.Many quotes say Mondays are Mondays but with Monday we now love Mondays!

You can basically make Monday do anything that other packages can do, and more, by customising it to your needs. Forms and timelines are a very nice addition, so now we run the roadmap on it, internal feedback and support system, almost everything.It's not perfect yet but I'm sure they are working on it and the limitations are insignificant.

It is so user friendly that I have shown co-workers how to use it well in less than 15 minutes. It is very easy to build custom boards and to communicate via software instead of impromptu hallway meetings.The downsides are that it is expensive. Half of my team is not able to use it due to budgeting (we have about 10 people). There is also not an option to sign up with a single user account, or perhaps a 2 person team. I would imagine that a family or small business could make great use of this!Having said that, it has been well worth the investment and I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for something to streamline their team's communication and projects!",1 review,False,<reviewer.Reviewer object at 0x7fc79f2c8f50>

I've been using the basic account but wanted to upgrade to the pro account for improved functionality, however I can now only have a five person account as a minimum with a ridiculous price tag of £69 a month! HUGELY disappointed that Monday.com has decided to effectively close off its software to users like me (I appealed to customer service to upgrade to pro on my current two person account but no positive help). Its hugely short sighted of Monday.com - as many small businesses grow into larger ones who would roll out the system as new people joined. By increasing the bill so much for startups like mine they are effectively forcing me to find a new system, and having to move for such negative reasons means I will not come back to them in the future, which is surely missing a huge organic marketing opportunity. Very short sighted and unsupportive of small businesses and sole traders when the difficulties of the pandemic really call for the absolute opposite approach.

,allison cornelius,1 star: Bad,VERY POOR SUPPORT DURING SALE AND CONFLICTING QUOTES,"We are a large nonprofit organization and started reviewing collaboration and project flow software about a month ago. We had narrowed it down to Wrike and Monday.com. Overall our leadership team preferred Monday.com due to the simplicity of the design, the price, the library of ready-to-use templates, and what looks to be an easy and intuitive user experience. However, the contrast between how these two companies have handled us as a potential customer has been remarkable and that’s what worries me.In my experience if a company cannot support the selling process, when you are trying to give them your money, then it probably won’t be much better after the sale.Monday.com gave us a trial period which they extended during the vetting process. They invited us to participate in a very, very large group demo which was not conducive to Q&A. We took several online tutorials and were sold on how easy Monday.com would be to learn, the design and feel, and their large library of ready-to-go templates. But we couldn’t figure out how we would structure our departments within the software and I could not see how the Senior Leadership Team would be able to get a quality 45,000 foot view of the organization’s work. It looked to me like we could end up with basically what equates to tons of task lists on steroids.Every time we submitted a question to Monday.com, we were doing it by email and communicating to someone different. That made choosing the right plan a bit difficult. Nevertheless, we decided to purchase Monday.com PRO LEVEL, and we asked for the NGO quote for the Pro Level.After several days of not getting a reply, we requested again. We then received a call from a 3rd party sales rep. When we attempted to call her back, there was no way to leave a voice mail. When we finally reached her, she told us she didn't know a lot about the details of the software (huh?) but that it sounded like we might actually need the higher Enterprise level. We looked at the features of Enterprise and realized Pro would not work for our needs. We then submitted another request for the NGO quote for Enterprise. We got that quote in writing a day later. When we attempted to follow the directions sent with the quote to purchase the product, the system required us to submit yet another contact form - which we did.We then received an email with a totally different price than the one sent the day before (about $8K-$10K higher!). We asked why we had been given two different quotes. Now during all this time, we are corresponding or speaking to Elisa, Erick, Helen, Lauren, Fanny, Tammy, and Noreply – the Customer Service Team. And that's while I am just trying to buy the product?Monday has a beautiful product that we liked better, but if they cannot answer simple questions accurately (like how much is it? and what do we need?) during the sales phase, I fear their support post sale will not be much different. It has been incredibly inefficient.In contrast, Wrike assigned one salesperson who did a live demo with our leadership team. She answered tons of questions and mined for more. Wrike also gave us a trial period and extended it. We vetted Wrike thoroughly and while we preferred some of its features, we worried it was far too expensive and too complex for our needs. It looked like a steep learning curve for our team. Wrike does not have lots of templates and we would have to make our own – we worried it would take too long to get it up and running.But during the sales process the Wrike rep has answered every question thoroughly and within a couple of hours, sometimes minutes. She has called us every day wanting to discuss their product's features and benefits against Monday.com's.My dad always told me when purchasing IT to never confuse sell with install. In this instance Monday.com does not even seem to be able to sell.Back to the drawing board.",1 review,True,<reviewer.Reviewer object at 0x7fcf6cccc450>

But:No way to make a rule about only one time tracking at the time. If you want to change task midt work, you will need to stop tracking on your current task and then start tracking on the next task.Should you track two task at the same time. There is no where to get an overview of your currenct time tracking sessions. So hope you do not have to many workspaces.When you find your session and want to change it to the currect time, will you an everyone else need to reload there browser to get the update in there statics page.Do not use Monday if time tracking is important for you. Either look for something else, or find a system that you can embed into Monday.com instead.I would love to see an overview of all my tasks in deadline order. I can't. I can see an overview of all my tasks for max 1 year ahead. But not for more then 10 workspaces at the time. I could search for my name in the search menu. But there is no way to order sorte the tasks.For small companyes this would not be a problem. But if you need to make pipeline for the next 2 years with over 1000 tasks. Well you are not going to have a good time with Monday.Support is fast at replying. 1-2 hours. I guess they have follow the sun support.But i fine my self asking for at feature or asking about a bug, and then getting told a solution, that do not fit the feature or fixing the bug.I have to ask them to stop talking about other features, before they inform me that the software can not fulfil my request.I also get a new support person every answer. Not a big deal, but I do get ask what my request is more the one time in the threat. Seems like there support is to busy to read the old messages in the support ticket.Monday have some good features. But all of them feel 80% done. They want to seem to be this 100% dynamic todo management software. But only 100% dynamic in 40% of the features. The rest is limited or do not work.If Monday had used maybe 50% of there youtube ad budget on testing and polish of there software, then maybe it would have been something i could requirement. Right now, is Asana + Everhour a better solution. Only part Asana is missing that Monday have is a workload tool and a proper timeline/milestone tool.",1 review,True,<reviewer.Reviewer object at 0x7fcf6cd45f50>

Their solution was to offer me a 10% discount on a yearly plan.Did you catch that? Their solution to overcharging me was to ask me to spend $1,100 to be locked in to a year of service instead of $120/mo when we haven't even had enough time with the service to know if it works well for our use case.Super tone-deaf.From a software usage perspective, so far it's just OK. It's a bit buggy and slow and they have a lot of nagging alerts prompting you to do walkthroughs which are annoying. Also, even though we've already paid for a level of service, there's a permanent ""Upgrade"" button in the UI that doesn't go away, prompting you to get a higher tier of service.

The colors help maintain fluidity and balance and the software itself allows us to maintain organization during times of having to handle multiple projects and tasks without losing where we last left off.We have imported several Excel spreadsheets successfully and now we can move items from ideation stages, to creation stages, to completion/published stages. Monday is systematically operational and effective across all levels!Also, the support is out of this world, this company truly cares about the user and user experience, they prioritize your satisfaction.Monday's services are unparallel to any other project management tools by far in terms of time, deliverability and especially by offering the whole package at a much cheaper cost.NOW our team can interact effectively and we can better coordinate without the use of google spreadsheets which can often take longer getting things done opposed to using Monday conveniently from your desktop.Many quotes say Mondays are Mondays but with Monday we now love Mondays!

,Patrick Krupa,5 stars: Excellent,The best project management software so far (and I used plenty).,"I used Trello, Basecamp, Asana, Jira, Meistertask and many others. And then Monday came and it was a no-brainer. The advantage is very simple - it wins by flexibility. You can basically make Monday do anything that other packages can do, and more, by customising it to your needs. Forms and timelines are a very nice addition, so now we run the roadmap on it, internal feedback and support system, almost everything.It's not perfect yet but I'm sure they are working on it and the limitations are insignificant. I wish for more colour options and column types, and text description for the task groups and it's super annoying when cursor jumps to the end of the line while typing the task name, but these are very minor matters.",2 reviews,False,<reviewer.Reviewer object at 0x7fcf6cc46590>

It has transformed the way projects are handled internally. There has been a significant increase in accountability, and the number of goals and tasks that are marked as complete is increasing every day. We have more visibility across the company and a more organised and happy team. All thanks to Monday.com.The integrations with some of our existing systems have reduced the amount of manual admin, and there has been a clear improvement in workflows. What originally started as a suggested tool to track internal projects, is now used company-wide from personal to-do lists, employee onboarding, hiring, and right through to large scale projects.I've had nothing but positive feedback from the team, and recommend it to pretty much everyone!",1 review,False,<reviewer.Reviewer object at 0x7fcf6c40c1d0>

,Brandon Gregory @SeminaryDad,4 stars: Great,I love Monday.com,"I love Monday.com! I have used other management software and they often did not live up to what they promised or were so clunky that I couldn't use them, Monday.com is not that. It is so user friendly that I have shown co-workers how to use it well in less than 15 minutes. It is very easy to build custom boards and to communicate via software instead of impromptu hallway meetings.The downsides are that it is expensive. Half of my team is not able to use it due to budgeting (we have about 10 people). There is also not an option to sign up with a single user account, or perhaps a 2 person team. I would imagine that a family or small business could make great use of this!Having said that, it has been well worth the investment and I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for something to streamline their team's communication and projects!",1 review,False,<reviewer.Reviewer object at 0x7fcf6c8c9e10>
